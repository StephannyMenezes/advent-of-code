# Advent of Code 2025 — Personal Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for Advent of Code 2025. Each day lives in its own folder and includes a minimal entrypoint to run the solution.

Quick notes

- Language: PHP (simple scripts per day)
- Purpose: personal challenge solutions, not a library

Prerequisites

- PHP 8.0+ installed

Run a solution
From the repository root you can run a day's solution directly. Examples:

```bash
php day-one/index.php
php day-two/index.php
```

Project structure

- `day-one/` — solution and input(s) for Day 1 (includes `rotation_sequence.txt`)
- `day-two/` — solution for Day 2

Notes

- Inputs are stored per-day where needed. Solutions read from the files included in each day's folder.
- These are my personal implementations for learning and reference.

Contributing

- Feel free to open issues or suggest improvements. Pull requests are welcome but may be unreviewed quickly.
